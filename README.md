# Hi! My name is Esteban Romero

I look to create new ways to explore the worlds within. Here you will find videogames and immersive experiences enabled by our brainwaves (EEG) and data.

Currently, I am an undegraduate student in biomedical engineering @ Tec de Monterrey. I am also working as a student intern @ NYU. 

## Portfolio

You will find my [portfolio](https://esromerog.github.io/esromerog/) in my main repository and published at the GitHub Site:
https://esromerog.github.io/esromerog/

It was entirely built by myself from scratch using:
* Blender for the 3D Models
* P5.js for the background visuals
* React for the user interface
* GSAP for the animations

Feel free to explore or dive directly into my projects by exploring the rest of my GitHub or going [directly to the portfolio](https://esromerog.github.io/esromerog/#/portfolio).

The [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQk79Ll9u4) was composed by [Berlinist](https://www.berlinistmusic.com) as the original soundtrack for Gris.
